The digitalocean-client provides a minimal interface to DigitalOcean's REST API v2. The primary interface is the DOClient class from the client module, initialized with an API token from the DigitalOcean API dashboard.

The client, on connect, fetches the created droplets in the user account to prevent further calls to the API. The client also provides a minimal helper to filter droplets based on their label.
